## Ingredients

    8 ounces shitakes, sliced
    3 carrots, sliced
    3 bok choy, sliced
    1.5 inch ginger, sliced
    4 tablespoons miso paste (I used red)
    8 cups broth (or half broth, half water)
    1 bundle soba noodles
    1 container tofu, cubed
    sliced green onions

## Directions

Fry shitake mushrooms in oil on medium heat for about 5 minutes.  Add carrots, ginger, and bok choy when mushrooms have released their juices.  Fry
two or three minutes on medium heat.  Add liquid and miso paste, boil for a few minutes, and season to taste.  Add soba noodles, cook 4 minutes.

Add tofu, remove from heat, top with green onions as desired.
