<p>Its taken me forever to create a blog, mostly because I didn&#8217;t like all of the blogging platforms out there. But I recently learned about <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.textile'>Jekyll</a> and <a href='http://pages.github.com/'>Github Pages</a>, which seemed like the perfect solution for a coder like me.</p>

<p>To put the pieces together, I followed the directions from <a href='http://cwoebker.com/posts/jekyll-blogging'>cwoebker&#8217;s blog</a>, including heavily copying his layout (eventually I&#8217;ll give it some unique styling &#8230;). In addition, he had a great post on <a href='http://cwoebker.com/posts/latex-math-magic'>including latex</a>, a feature I will definitley want to use for some of my technical notes. An example:</p>

<h4 id='the_lorentz_equations'>The Lorentz Equations</h4>

<p><code>\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} &amp; = \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y} &amp; = \rho x - y - xz \\
\dot{z} &amp; = -\beta z + xy
\end{aligned}
\]</code></p>
