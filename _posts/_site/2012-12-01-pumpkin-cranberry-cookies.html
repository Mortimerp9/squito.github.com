<p>If you&#8217;ve never used fresh cranberries before, they should be hard, not mushy, and totally white on the inside. They&#8217;ll become soft and deep red when baked. I&#8217;ve also made this with frozen cranberries, its still pretty good.</p>

<p>Cutting the cranberries is the only time-consuming part of this. I&#8217;ve found that three or four quick pulses in the food processor works decently, and saves a lot of time. Only use the firm cranberries, work in small batches, and there will still be a few that you need to chop by hand, but it still helps.</p>
