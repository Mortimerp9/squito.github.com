<p>Great post on the LingPipe Blog giving a thorough <a href='http://lingpipe-blog.com/2010/07/13/collapsed-gibbs-sampling-for-lda-bayesian-naive-bayes/'>derivation of Collapsed Gibbs Sampling For LDA</a>. Even if you can&#8217;t make it through all the integrals, just reading through the derivation gave me a much better sense of what was going on in Collapsed Gibbs Sampling.</p>
