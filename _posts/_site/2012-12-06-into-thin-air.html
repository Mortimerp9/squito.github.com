<p>I&#8217;ve been getting into the outdoors more and more recently, and had started toying with the idea of getting outdoors more even during the winter months; winter camping, mountaineering, ice climbing perhaps &#8211; much more &#8220;extreme&#8221; pursuits than my normal fare. So, I picked up a copy of <em>Into Thin Air</em> by Jon Krakauer as my first step; surprisingly, reading about the deadly expedition on Mt. Everest only increased my interest.</p>

<p>So, I should temper my review with the fact that I was deeply interested in the subject matter. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend this as light reading to everybody. But the book goes beyond a simple day-by-day narrative of the events that unfolded, including a portrait of the people that undertake these expeditions, and what motivates them.</p>

<p>I certainly don&#8217;t have any intentions of trying anything nearly as hard as climbing Mt. Everest. I did gain a lot of respect for the sport, and admire the intense desire and determination of everyone involved. I also realized they were all completely insane for not turning back. But, it did make me wonder what my limits were &#8211; what dangers am I wiling to deal with? How far could I push myself? The experience was made much more vivid by the author&#8217;s inclusion of his own shortcomings and mistakes; how much he struggled, his doubts of his companions, and his own state of confusion when he ran out of oxygen.</p>

<p>Its not for everybody, but <em>Into Thin Air</em> is more than just a step-by-step for those planning (or dreaming of) their own trip up Everest. Its a good read for anyone interested in the power of nature, and the human ability to endure.</p>
