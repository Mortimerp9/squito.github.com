<p>So far my blog has been a random combination of recipes, book reviews, and technical posts. In this post, I&#8217;ll at least combine two of those topics with a review of &#8220;Les Bonnes Femmes&#8221;, a cookbook by Wini Morainville.</p>

<p>I wish I had found this book years ago, as I was just learning the basics of cooking. It may not be for total beginners &#8211; maybe I shoudl have got it just after college &#8211; but Wini really does present a wonderful mix of recipes that are relatively easy and still able to wow dinner guests. In particular, I love the section on &#8220;Saute, Deglaze, Serve&#8221; &#8211; she explains the basic technique, and then gives a huge range of recipes that are all ust minor variations.</p>

<p>While I knew the technique from some recipes I had learned previously, I definitely didn&#8217;t have the breadth of variations at my fingertips. At first, I thought I would get bored with those dishes, that they all probably tasted the same, since the directions were so similar. But I couldn&#8217;t believe how different (and how marvelous!) the recipe for Chicken Tarragon turned out.</p>

<p>Virtually everything I&#8217;ve cooked from that book has been fantastic. (The only exception was the Saffron-Vermouth Sauce that we had over halibut &#8211; those flavors just didn&#8217;t go together to our taste.) Here are a couple of highlights:</p>

<ul>
<li>The variation on Chicken Pot Pie was unbelievable. I already make a Chicken Pot Pie which my wife loves, so I was really surprised when this recipe was both more delicious <em>and</em> easier to make!</li>

<li>I&#8217;ve already mentioned how the Chicken Tarragon put a wonderful new spin on a familiar technique</li>
</ul>

<p>I hope you get a chance to check &#8220;Les Bonnes Femmes&#8221; out and love it as much as I do! I&#8217;d love to hear any other recommendations you have for great cookbooks.</p>
