Great post on the LingPipe Blog giving a thorough [derivation of Collapsed Gibbs Sampling For LDA](http://lingpipe-blog.com/2010/07/13/collapsed-gibbs-sampling-for-lda-bayesian-naive-bayes/).  Even if you can't make it through all the integrals, just reading through the derivation gave me a much better sense of what was going on in Collapsed Gibbs Sampling.
