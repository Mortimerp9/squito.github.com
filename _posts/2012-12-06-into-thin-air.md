I've been getting into the outdoors more and more recently, and had started toying with the
idea of getting outdoors more even during the winter months; winter camping, mountaineering,
ice climbing perhaps -- much more "extreme" pursuits than my normal fare.  So, I picked up
a copy of _Into Thin Air_ by Jon Krakauer as my first step; surprisingly, reading about the deadly expedition
on Mt. Everest only increased my interest.

So, I should temper my review with the fact that I was deeply interested in the subject matter.  I wouldn't
recommend this as light reading to everybody.  But the book goes beyond a simple
day-by-day narrative of the events that unfolded, including a portrait of the people that undertake
these expeditions, and what motivates them.  

I certainly don't have any intentions of trying anything nearly as hard as climbing Mt. Everest.  I did gain a lot
of respect for the sport, and admire the intense desire and determination of everyone involved.
I also realized they were all completely insane for not turning back.  But, it did
make me wonder what my limits were -- what dangers am I wiling to deal with?  How far could I push myself?  The experience
was made much more vivid by the author's inclusion of his own shortcomings and mistakes; how much he struggled, his doubts
of his companions, and his own state of confusion when he ran out of oxygen.

Its not for everybody, but _Into Thin Air_ is more than just a step-by-step for those planning (or dreaming of) their
own trip up Everest.  Its a good read for anyone interested in the power of nature, and the human ability to endure.
