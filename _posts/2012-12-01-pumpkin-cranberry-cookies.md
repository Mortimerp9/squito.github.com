## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup butter, softened
* 1 cup white sugar
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 1 egg
* 1 1/4 cup solid pack pumpkin puree
* 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1.5 - 2 cups fresh cranberries
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg
* 1 tablespoon orange zest (optional)


## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets.

2. In a large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and
fluffy. Beat in vanilla, egg and pumpkin. Sift together the flour,
baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg; stir into mixture until
well blended. Cut the cranberries in half and stir into mixture along
with the orange zest. Drop by teaspoonfuls onto cookie
sheets.

3. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes.


## Notes

The only time consuming part of this is cutting the cranberries.  If you've never used fresh cranberries
before, they should be hard, not mushy, and totally white on the inside.  They'll become soft and deep
red when baked.  I've also made this with frozen cranberries, its still pretty good.
