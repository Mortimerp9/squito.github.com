So far my blog has been a random combination of recipes, book reviews, and technical posts.  In this post,
I'll at least combine two of those topics with a review of "Les Bonnes Femmes", a cookbook by Wini Morainville.

I wish I had found this book years ago, as I was just learning the basics of cooking.  It may not be for total
beginners -- maybe I shoudl have got it just after college -- but Wini really does present a wonderful mix of 
recipes that are relatively easy and still able to wow dinner guests.  In particular, I love the section on
"Saute, Deglaze, Serve" -- she explains the basic technique, and then gives a huge range of recipes that are
all ust minor variations.  

While I knew the technique from some recipes I had learned previously, I definitely
didn't have the breadth of variations at my fingertips.  At first, I thought I would get bored with those dishes,
that they all probably tasted the same, since the directions were so similar.  But I couldn't believe how different
(and how marvelous!) the recipe for Chicken Tarragon turned out.

Virtually everything I've cooked from that book has been fantastic.  (The only exception was the Saffron-Vermouth Sauce
that we had over halibut -- those flavors just didn't go together to our taste.)  Here are a couple of highlights:

* The variation on Chicken Pot Pie was unbelievable.  I already make a Chicken Pot Pie which my wife loves, so I was really
surprised when this recipe was both more delicious *and* easier to make!
* I've already mentioned how the Chicken Tarragon put a wonderful new spin on a familiar technique



I hope you get a chance to check "Les Bonnes Femmes" out and love it as much as I do!  I'd love to hear any other recommendations
you have for great cookbooks.
