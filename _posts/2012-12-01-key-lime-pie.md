## Ingredients

* 1 can condensed milk
* 3 egg yolks
* 1/2 c lime juice  (fresh squeezed if possible, we've also used "Nellie & Joe's" brand before, probably anything would work)
* zest of 1 lime (optional)
* 1 graham cracker crust

## Directions 

Preheat oven to 350 degrees.

Mix first four ingredients with electric mixer until fully mixed.
Pour into graham cracker crust.

Bake for 15-20 minutes.  Let cool for at least 15 minutes before
placing in refrigerator.
