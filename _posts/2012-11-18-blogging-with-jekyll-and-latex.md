Its taken me forever to create a blog, mostly because I didn't like all of the blogging platforms out there.  But I recently
learned about [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.textile) and [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/),
which seemed like the perfect solution for a coder like me.

To put the pieces together, I followed the directions from [cwoebker's blog](http://cwoebker.com/posts/jekyll-blogging), including
heavily copying his layout (eventually I'll give it some unique styling ...).  In addition, he had a great post on [including latex](http://cwoebker.com/posts/latex-math-magic),
a feature I will definitley want to use for some of my technical notes.  An example:

#### The Lorentz Equations

`\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\
\dot{y} & = \rho x - y - xz \\
\dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy
\end{aligned}
\]`
